### Gulp-Tasks
##### Personally crafted gulp tasks for simple websites.

---

This repo contains some gulp tasks that will help you become a better and faster developer. It can be tweaked for more complex web apps, but out of the box it is ready for simple websites. It will handle any scripts, styles and images you throw in your project.

`src` directory contains some default files of "scripts" and "styles", so you get the idea of how to structure your project!

If you'd like to make some changes, take a look at `gulp/config.js` for any possible configurations that I've made.
